# Migrating from PHP-DI 4.x to 5.0

PHP-DI 5.0 is a new major version that comes with backward compatibility breaks.

This guide will help you migrate from a 4.x version to 5.0. It will only explain backward compatibility breaks, it will not present the new features (read the release notes or the blog post for that).

## PHP version requirement

PHP-DI 5 requires a PHP version greater or equal than 5.4 (was previously 5.3).

## Container

`DI\ContainerInterface` was deprecated since v4.1 and has been removed. It was replaced by [the standard `Interop\Container\ContainerInterface`](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop/blob/master/src/Interop/Container/ContainerInterface.php).

## Definitions

### Annotations

Annotations are now disabled by default. If you use annotations, simply enable them in your config:

```php
$builder = new ContainerBuilder();
$builder->useAnnotations(true);

$container = $builder->build();
```

### Factories

Closures are now considered as factories automatically:

```php
return [
    'foo' => DI\factory(function () {
        return new Foo();
    }),
    // can now be shortened to:
    'foo' => function () {
        return new Foo();
    },
];
```

If you defined a closure as a value (e.g. to have the closure injected in a class), you need to wrap the closure with the new `DI\value()` helper:

```php
    // the closure will be injected instead of being called
    'foo' => DI\value(function () {
        return new Foo();
    }),
```

### Scopes

The internal implementation of scopes has been simplified: this results in one less Composer dependency and better performances. Backward compatibility is kept so you don't have to change anything, however if you want you can replace the use of static methods (which might be deprecated in the future) with the constants.

Before:

```php
return [
    'MyClass' => DI\object()
        ->scope(Scope::PROTOTYPE()), // static method
];
```

After:

```php
return [
    'MyClass' => DI\object()
        ->scope(Scope::PROTOTYPE), // constant
];
```

Again, this change is optional, the static methods still work.

## Lazy injection

The [ProxyManager](https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager) package comes with a lot of dependencies and is only useful only for lazy injection. This package is not installed by default in v5.0 in order to lighten PHP-DI's dependencies.

If you want to use **lazy injection**, you now need to install it explicitly:

```
composer require "ocramius/proxy-manager:~1.0"
```

Read more in [#198](https://github.com/mnapoli/PHP-DI/issues/198) or in the [Lazy Injection documentation](../lazy-injection.md).

## Internal changes

If you were overriding or extending some internal classes of PHP-DI, be aware that they may have changed. For example definition sources have been refactored into a much simpler design.
