# Migrating from PHP-DI 4.x to 5.0

PHP-DI 5.0 is a new major version that comes with backward compatibility breaks.

This guide will help you migrate from a 4.x version to 5.0. It will only explain backward compatibility breaks, it will not present the new features (read the release notes or the blog post for that).

## Container

`DI\ContainerInterface` was deprecated since v4.1 and has been removed. It was replaced by [the standard `Interop\Container\ContainerInterface`](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop/blob/master/src/Interop/Container/ContainerInterface.php).

## Definitions

### Annotations

Annotations are now disabled by default. If you use annotations, simply enable them in your config:

```php
$builder = new ContainerBuilder();
$builder->useAnnotations(true);

$container = $builder->build();
```

### Factories

Closures are now considered as factories automatically:

```php
return [
    'foo' => DI\factory(function () {
        return new Foo();
    }),
    // can now be shortened to:
    'foo' => function () {
        return new Foo();
    },
];
```

If you defined a closure as a value (e.g. to have the closure injected in a class), you need to wrap the closure with the new `DI\value()` helper:

```php
    // the closure will be injected instead of being called
    'foo' => DI\value(function () {
        return new Foo();
    }),
```

## Lazy injection

The [ProxyManager](https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager) package comes with a lot of dependencies and is only useful only for lazy injection. This package is not installed by default in v5.0 in order to lighten PHP-DI's dependencies.

If you want to use **lazy injection**, you now need to install it explicitly:

```
composer require ocramius/proxy-manager
```

Read more in [#198](https://github.com/mnapoli/PHP-DI/issues/198) or in the [Lazy Injection documentation](../lazy-injection.md).

## Internal changes

If you were overriding or extending some internal classes of PHP-DI, be aware that they may have changed. For example definition sources have been refactored into a much simpler design.
