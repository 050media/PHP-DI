# Migrating from PHP-DI 6.x to 7.0

PHP-DI 7.0 is a new major version that comes with backward compatibility breaks.

This guide will help you migrate from a 6.x version to 7.0. It will only explain backward compatibility breaks, it will not present the new features (read the release notes or the blog post for that).

## PHP version

PHP-DI now requires PHP 8.0 or greater. If you are using an older version, you can of course still use PHP-DI 6.

## PHPdoc types are ignored by `@Inject`

Now that PHP 7.4 and up supports typed properties, PHP-DI will stop reading types from phpdoc.

Here is an example on how to migrate from PHP-DI 6 to PHP-DI 7:

- **before:**

```php
class Example
{
    /**
     * @Inject
     * @var Foo
     */
    private $property;

    /**
     * @Inject
     * @param Foo $param
     */
    public function method($param)
    {
    }
}
```

- **after:**

```php
class Example
{
    /**
     * @Inject
     */
    private Foo $property;

    /**
     * @Inject
     */
    public function method(Foo $param)
    {
    }
}
```

## Internal changes

If you were overriding or extending some internal classes of PHP-DI, be aware that they may have changed.
